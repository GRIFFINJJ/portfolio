                    In order to acquire a stable career in writing and editing, I hope to develop a varied and expansive array of skills that help me stand out compared to other potential competing candidates. This includes building a portfolio of published works, experience in multiple different kinds of projects within advertisement and journalism, and the development of a grander set of contacts and references.

                <p>
                    Years of education and a passion for language and communication has put me on the path of wanting to earn a degree within the field of English and Communications so that I find a career within this broad field. I've had a wonderful time learning from the skilled professors within the University of Wisconsin – Eau Claire and have only one final year before I graduate at this institution.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    I've written all sorts of short stories and poems over the years, but I would love to have the opportunity to create a series of grand adventures told within a long-form fiction novel. The amount of patience and dedication that this project will require will be immense, but the journey of it all is something I’d like to live through at least once in my life. Fiction novels don’t always perform well after being published, so this would likely be something I complete once I've established myself a bit more as a writer.

                <p>
                    In 2021 I began working on an online tabletop gaming community. “The Cantina” currently has over 15 members including myself and is looking forward to expanding this figure in the coming year. I’d like this group to build in members as the group becomes more and more popular, eventually building into something that I am no longer the lone head figure of.

                    I love writing and storytelling. I think it's something that everyone should aspire to do, communication is key in ensuring communal safety and wellness. Someday I’d like to put together a series of nonfiction stories revolving around the people who raised me and the histories of the older people who live near my family home. I began this process with the interview of a Ukrainian woman who moved to the US in the 50’s following the terrors of the Second World War. This passion isn't just limited to English, I've spent over six years now building my knowledge of the Spanish language and know upwards of 1,700 different words.

                    My family has had a close connection and involvement with the outdoors and environmental awareness since I was a young child. Together we have participated in all sorts of services for different scientific communities within Wisconsin. Recreationally we enjoy camping and hiking the hills and valleys of the Midwest and beyond and make regular donations to wildlife associations and wildlife sanctuaries.

I strongly believe that together we can ensure a brighter future for us all, and it is the community’s responsibility to ensure mutual success wherever possible. In the pursuit of public safety and wellness, I hope to improve lines of communication and give voices that aren’t usually heard a chance to speak.
